"William was incredible even before he got there! The window I was given was 3-5, and at 2:45, I received a text that said he was en route. He arrived promptly at 3:00!  He diagnosed the problem, talked through what was going on, and how he was going to address it, and gave me all of the necessary info for what was to come within the next few years with the system. On top of everything else, his prices were great!"

"William has done an excellent job with Installation of Mini split AC in my living room. I was running short of time and had to get it installed before I left for my vacation. From in house consultation to getting the AC installed was swift and on time."

"William was able to come within 24 hours to fix my air conditioner during a summer heat wave.  I was so grateful for his service and counsel. He was on time, able to diagnose the problem quickly, made a few adjustments and replaced a part.  Once the cool air started,  I wanted to hug him!  Heather in the office was very kind on the phone, reassured me they could come soon.  When she said the next day, I was shocked as the company I have had a service contract with for over 10 years told me 3 weeks or 500 dollars for an emergency call in a week.  I am done with othe other company, I am now a convert to Northern Comfort with William and Heather!  Thank you both for being so professional and kind."
